# Introduction

This is the Caltech Birds respository using PyTorch CNNs for image classification (CUB-200-2011).

This is a collection of notebooks and tools designed to show how to setup, build, train and evaluate Convolutional Neural Network architectures using PyTorch, Torchvision and other 3rd party packages, to generate state-of-the-art classification results on a fine-grained, long-tailed distribution classification problem.

The repository includes a set of example notebooks which walks the user through all the processes required to train and evaluate a network, as well as interrogate what and how the network is making it's decisions through the use of neuron, layer and spatial activations interpretation ([Lucent](https://github.com/greentfrapp/lucent)) and image feature attributions ([Captum](https://captum.ai/)).
